# TODO

Delete entries when they are done. Static-language and English work lives in [Pets TODO](../pets/TODO.md).

- Investigate the deferred nested-placement and partial-selection experiment in
  [Make types types again](agents/MAKE_TYPES_TYPES_AGAIN.md) if that proposal is selected.

- Investigate the local configuration-cache invalidation caused by the injected
  `kotlin.project.persistent.dir` property. Repeated `help` commands reproduce it on the
  pre-split baseline as well as the composite build; build separation preserves the existing
  generated-state isolation rather than redesigning it.

- Verify IDE source navigation and editing across the separate Pets and Solarnet builds.
  The command-line check proves that an unpublished Pets edit reaches a Solarnet test;
  the interactive IDE acceptance check remains unverified.

- Wild tags are not yet supported when Robotic Workforce or Cyberia Systems copies production:
  Research Network cannot be selected through its wild, and copied Gyropolis does not allocate
  Earth tags for its production. Allocate only after the copy target is known; preserve Building
  counting for Medical Lab and keep each assignment for the whole action. Bug-test pairs cover
  the rejected Research Network copies.

- Finish faithful coverage of the 2026-10-14 unanswered-rules scenarios where current content or
  inputs cannot express the situation. `UnknownRulesTest` covers rejecting partial Celestic and
  Morning Star search counts (question 8), but not exhaustion after finding some cards: searches
  have no deck or discard supply. Question 16 (Helion retaining 2 MC while paying partial Mons
  Insurance with heat) needs real Helion; only `FakeHelion`, explicitly lacking correct payment
  allocation, exists. Do not treat that stand-in as evidence for the Canon interaction.

- Derive `TfmActionLowerer`'s standard-resource cost classification from Pets declarations
  instead of its hardcoded resource list, without adding a loading stage.
- Decide whether to add shallow/deep ELSE or instruction-level `(A)*`; candidate uses and
  restrictions are in [ELSE.md](../pets/docs/agents/ELSE.md).
- Add Canon invariant tests for incompatibilities: self-heat removal outside Billing, except
  Local Heat Trapping, must be declared incompatible with Stormcraft. Include abstract resource choices.
- Revisit Stormcraft plus Helion payment composition if that combination is supported.
  `Accepting` now skips alternative standard-resource offers when the payer has none; it does not
  consider possible substitutes such as Stormcraft floaters for heat.
- Verify as a Canon invariant which tasks can interleave with card play, including gaining MC
  production and other actual exceptions. Fake Head Start currently allows interleaving as a
  known approximation, not a requirement.
- Consider renaming automatic (`::`) effects to “immediate.”
- Replace the archived *Life of an Effect* walkthrough with a current account of lexical `Me`
  and the transformation pipeline.
- Review `pets/docs/class-existence-scenarios-draft.md` and consolidate repeated cases in
  `ClassDefinitionBoundaryTest` and `ClassTableSelectionTest`.
- Decide whether Agent submissions must use concrete amounts instead of arithmetic over `Owed`.
- Give beginner and standard players the same ten-card `Selecting` offer; beginners keep it free,
  while standard players discard and buy their choices.
- Clarify Astra Mechanica's zero/one/two eligible-event behavior and reconcile its modeled return
  with printed and derived English.
- Separate task selection from execution when automatic execution is disabled.
- Investigate selecting tasks by their main class without narrowing them, including grouped
  instructions, so more sandbox `selectOnlyTask` calls can use meaningful names.
- actually plan out how exMachina should work
- Replace ordering-only `::` protocols in pricing/acceptance, wild-tag preparation, and
  Turmoil/Politician influence measurement. Decompose government formation before judging its
  individual invariant repairs; `THEN` on a signal does not wait for its triggered work.
- Remove bootstrap/client-shape reasons for `::`: default offer counts before signed adjustments,
  inferred construction order, and bundled card-search/reward/Audit work. Preserve meaningful
  correction relationships and avoid adding client steps.
- Revisit queued requirement adjustments without adding a player step: `Required` is System, but
  `-2 Required<Class<GlobalParameter>>` remains abstract until selection. Inventrix, Adaptation
  Technology, and Special Design therefore still use immediate live narrowing.

- Revisit ownership of `Selecting`, `Hand`, and played events together, including per-player
  cleanup of shared `Selecting` while other players' starting offers remain there.
- Determine which nested cross-Actor Agent calls should settle Admin work before returning;
  the Pluto scenario in `ColoniesRulesTest` currently uses separate top-level calls.

- Briber's self-claim requirement still appears as `[Briber]`; keep it separate from the direct
  `Lose 12 M€` effect. The marked-variable references now follow recorded occurrences, but the older
  interaction-trigger Anyone-to-Player normalization still supplies an implicit `that player`.
- Investigate repeated selection probes followed by execution under `EAGER`; preserve manual-task
  competition and failure handling before removing probes.
- Investigate repeated ranking of the same field while testing each candidate. Scores must reflect
  the current state, including rollback; avoid a second persistent representation of game scores.

- Verify remaining inferred Research counts, anonymous draws, action grouping, and earlier
  adopted card identities in `Wsbg2025Test`. Jon's generation-six two-card Research keep now
  reconciles his confirmed patent sale to afford Robinson and zero ending cash; the purchase
  count itself is still inferred. All four final scores match, and no unexplained exMachina
  remains. Charlie's recorded Miranda overpayment/refund is intentional and does not need
  solving. Evidence and remaining uncertainties are in `_local/replays/Game20250919/sources.md`
  and `derived/action-inventory.md`.
